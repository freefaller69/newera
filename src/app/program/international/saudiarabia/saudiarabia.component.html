  <p>The Saut Education and Training Center, formerly known as Al-Nahda Schools for Down Syndrome, was started in 1987 by a parent, Ericka Koffroth Sabaan. While living in Portland, Oregon, Ericka met and married a Saudi native. When their second daughter was born with Down syndrome, she and her daughter entered the PRIDE School in Vancouver, Washington, where they received exceptional training. PRIDE was a replication site of the National Diffusion Network's validated model, Program for Children with Down Syndrome and Other Developmental Delays, Experimental Education Unit, University of Washington. (UW).</p>

  <p>When Ericka moved to Riyadh with her family, she discovered there were no early intervention services available for her daughter and sought help to establish a program. The Al-Nahda Philanthropic Society for Women stepped forward and sponsored a preschool that started out with four children in 1987. The training and consultation for the new program were led by Dr. Valentine Dmitriev, the original coordinator of the UW program, via long, very long, distance, using the Boeing mail service. Dr. Dmitriev and Nancy Warren, the coordinator of the PRIDE program at the time, made video tapes demonstrating teaching techniques to facilitate development as well as how to set up and manage preschool classrooms. These videotapes, and Dr. Dmitriev's book, <span class="booktitle">Time to Begin</span> (1982), and a year after the school opened, <span class="booktitle">Advances in Down Syndrome</span> (Dmitrtiev &amp; Oelwein, 1988) all in English, were the primary resources available as the program began.</p>

  <p>In November 1991, Patricia Oelwein, who at the time was coordinator of the Down Syndrome Program at the Center on Human
    Development and Disability, visited the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the first time. She made a commitment to the Al-Nahda
    Philanthropic Society for Women to provide on-going consultant services to develop the educational program and provide
    training as a part of an educational team that currently includes Cynthia Branson, SLP, Patricia Winders, PT, and Susan
    Sandall, Ph.D. at the University of Washington. Due to the unrelenting support of the Al-Nahda Philanthropic Society
    for Women and the dedication of the administrative and instructional staffs, the goals stated in the original proposal
    have long since been met and exceeded. The model programs have been developed, and the manuals, assessments and classroom
    materials are available in Arabic. Saudi Arabia now has model programs for individuals with Down syndrome, adapted to
    their culture, and exceptional in both quality and scope, providing specialize services from infancy to adulthood.</p>

  <p>While the Al-Nahda Schools for Down Syndrome demonstrated the impact of effective instruction and service, enrollment was
    limited to approximately 160 students. The waiting list had grown to over 800, demonstrating an overwhelming number of
    underserved children with Down syndrome in Riyadh. The great need led to the founding of Saut: The Voice of Down Syndrome
    Society to address the demand for specialized educational opportunities for children with Down syndrome throughout the
    kingdom. In addition to providing pre-service and in-service training for teachers and support staff locally, the society
    plans to eventually replicate the Saut Education and Training Center and open satellite offices in different cities in
    KSA where there is the greatest demand. Each education and training center and satellite office will then provide training
    for teachers, parents and support staff so the education model can be effectively implemented in each local setting.
    This is the beginning of a new era for Down syndrome education in Saudi Arabia, an era in which increasing numbers of
    children with Down syndrome have access to an education that meets their special needs--an era in which they have their
    own society that gives them a voice. Patricia Oelwein developed model programs that provide services from infants to
    supported employment at age 21 years. She is currently writing new manuals for each program.

  <p>Congratulations to Down Syndrome Program, University of Washington, on its 40th anniversary! The global impact of this
    program is exemplified by the success and quality our model programs at the Saut Education and Training Center, Riyadh,
    Saudi Arabia. We are most fortunate to have had Patricia Oelwein as our consultant and mentor since 1991. Without her,
    we would not have been able to develop our four model programs, activity-based developmental, applied academic/functional,
    community-based vocational training, and supported employment, which are currently serving as educational models throughout
    the nation.</p>

  <p>The World Health Organization, Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office, awarded the Saut Education and Training Center (formerly
    the Al-Nahda School for Down Syndrome), the 2010 Down Syndrome Research and Education Award for their outstanding work
    in the Field of Down Syndrome in the Middle East. We attribute this success to Pat Oelwein and our other consultants,
    Patricia Winders and Cynthia Branson. These innovative programs, that we are so proud of, would not have happened without
    them.</p>

  <p>Congratulations to the University of Washington's remarkable program for children with Down syndrome now celebrating 40
    years of educational excellence and innovation. Since its inception the program has harnessed sound principles, systematic
    instruction and individually tailored student programs.</p>

  <p>Interest in the program developed at UW has been worldwide. I have had the pleasure of helping with the establishment of
    a Down syndrome program in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for over 15 years. The Al Nahda Philanthropic Society for Women founded
    three schools for the special education of children of all ages with Down syndrome with the support of consultants from
    the UW and elsewhere. Over the years every student in the schools has enjoyed a quality education embracing the academic
    principles, methodologies, behavioral support and team commitments that characterize the program born at UW four decades
    ago.</p>

  <p> In Saudi Arabia the schools have flourished and have served as models for the nation. What a tribute to the history and
    quality of the UW program that the Saudi's are now working on development of a national curriculum through the SAUT Society
    to carry the work begun in education of students with Down syndrome to a level that I am sure will be noticed throughout
    the region and beyond.
