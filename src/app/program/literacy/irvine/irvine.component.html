  <h4>Children learn to read, write, and love the process</h4>
  <p>Many years ago, I was working with children with special needs in a school district. Three of the kindergarten children had Down syndrome. I was eager to teach them, but I was discouraged that the classroom curriculum was not meeting their needs.  One of the parents gave me a book she was reading: <span class="booktitle"><q>Teaching Reading to Children with Down Syndrome,</q></span> by Pat Oelwein. This book was the answer to my prayers. It gave me a template to work with, it gave me ideas, and it gave me hope!</p>

  <p>I used the methodology and sure enough my three students with Down syndrome began to read, and most importantly, they enjoyed the process of learning. I soon began to work privately with the three students in my home. Today, I teach over 50 learners with Down syndrome ages 3-31.</p>

  <p>Throughout the years, I have given and continue to give workshops to parents and professionals. I have developed programs for Down syndrome associations and have mentored those that are interested in my work.</p>

  <p>To say that I am grateful for Patricia Oelwein and the work that began 40 years ago is an understatement. I have found my life&rsquo;s work because of Patricia&rsquo;s work. Being given the opportunity to help so many children to learn to read, write, and love the process of learning is the most rewarding way for one to spend their days!</p>

  <p>Please visit the <q>So Happy to Learn</q> website as well as my <span class="booktitle"><q>Teaching Reading to Children with Down Syndrome</q></span> book review/video on amazon.com. There you will see the fruits of Pat&rsquo;s labors that began in the University of Washington Down Syndrome Program!</p>

  <p>I have a six year old son named Toby, who has Down syndrome. As a teacher, I taught Toby all the names of the letters and their sounds by age 2.5. I knew he was a visual learner but did not know what the next step would be for him. I heard about Patricia Oelwein&rsquo;s book and bought it. We made a family book and he began reading.  I also heard about a wonderful teacher in the area, Terry Brown, who was influenced by Patricia and that Terry teaches children with Down syndrome how to read. Luckily, Toby got to see Terry and began reading more sentences from Terry&rsquo;s creative book collection on the first visit. I was so impressed! I even started to use the techniques in my Kindergarten classroom and the children began to read quickly. Reading has been a strength for Toby, due to all Terry&rsquo;s support. His ability to read before entering Kindergarten was so important for his self-esteem while being fully included in a general education classroom. My hat is off to both Terry and Patricia&rsquo;s influences. It has opened doors for his future. Our family is forever grateful.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;m a very thankful Mom who has been taking our daughter Danielle to Terry Brown for about four years now. We have seen your methods being taught from your book, and I am so amazed at our daughter progress over the years!  You&rsquo;ve given SO many families, hope, joy, peace, and comfort knowing that so many truly believe in all of our kids&rsquo; gifts and talents! We are truly grateful to you for caring enough about our children to write this book.</p>

  <p>Our six year old daughter, Mia, currently benefits from the marvelous insight of Patricia Oelwein every week when she meets with Terry Brown who learned from Pat&rsquo;s work many years ago. We believe that the work Terry has done with Mia each week for the last 2 1/2 years, has been a huge factor in Mia&rsquo;s successful inclusion in a typical kindergarten class this year (and even without an aide). Mia loves to learn because of Patricia Oelwein!</p>
